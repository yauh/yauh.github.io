Hi, I am Stephan from Germany. I love technology and taking things apart and putting them back together and see what happens. Back in the day this was only referring to software, but for the last couple of years I became more involved in the Internet of Things (IoT) space with a focus on intelligent buildings and smart products.

This is my personal blog that documents what worked well for me with making my own home smarter and coming closer to that utopian vision where techology actually serves us in useful ways.
