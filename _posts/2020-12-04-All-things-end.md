title: All Things End - Goodbye yauh!
categories: [meta, news]

Hello all,

since 1999 I've been using the yauh acronym. For a long time it stood for "yet another useless homepage" - heavily inspired by the old SuSe Linux install tool yast.

However, all things must come to an end. I realized that yauh is not the trademark I can use any longer. First, I always need to explain that - indeed - it is not spelled yahoo. Second, because everything that once was connected with this acronym is not valid beyond 2020 anymore. 

I will keep the domain for mails, but writing may happen elsewhere. Thanks for sticking with me for such a long time. See you on the web ;)
